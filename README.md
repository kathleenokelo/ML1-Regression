### Blueberry yield project
This project aims to develop a regression model to predict based on Blueberry Prediction Dataset. Regression analysis is a statistical method for investigating relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts the target variable based on the given features.
